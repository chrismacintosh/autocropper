#Autocropper
The purpose of this utility is to actively crop small portions of photographs as they're onloaded to your computer.

In the event that someone steals your photographs and tries to claim them as their own, you simply need to produce the uncropped version. This is suitible proof of ownership to have websites takedown content that is in violation of Copyright Infringement.
